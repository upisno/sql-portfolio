# üçú Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner

## Overview

## Database
The case study uses the three following tables:

- The `sales` table has three fields, `customer_id`, `order_date`, and `product_id`, allowing us to track what menu item was purchased, on what date, and by which customer.

- The `menu` table also has three fields, `product_id`, `product_name`, and `price`, allowing us to track the name and price of each product sold at Danny's Diner.

- The `members` table has two fields, `customer_id` and `join_date`, which records when each customer (where applicable) joined the beta loyalty program at Danny's Diner.
